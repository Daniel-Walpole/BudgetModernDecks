                        <h2>White One Dollar Cards</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Containment Priest</b> -  $0.30 - This card is a wonderful sideboard card to fight the current creativity decks and is wonderfully stated for a white weenie deck or humans deck</li>
                            <li><b>Kor Firewalker</b> - $0.25 - This is also a good sideboard card to fight red decks especially burn depending on the metagame of your local area this card can do work</li>
                            <li><b>Mana Tithe</b> - $0.30 - This is an interesting one as it is not a card most people will play but it does get people hard once a player falls for this counter they will almost always play around it forever after.</li>
                            <li><b>Wall of Omens</b> - $0.25 - Do you like drawing cards? Do you like a good blocker? This card does so much for so cheep the only thing it can't do without help is win the game.</li>
                            <li><b>Blade Splicer</b> - $0.35 - 3 mana for a 1/1 is a bit steep but it does come with a 3/3 friend as well so that seems pretty great! With blink effects this card can provide enough bodies to help close games</li>
                            <li><b>Mirran Crusader</b> - $0.35 - This card is wonderful for getting past those pesky black and green creatures and spells, however if the area you play in is filled with red cards this is something to maybe stay away from.</li>
                            <li><b>Sun Titan</b> - $0.50 - At 6 mana it's a bit of a commitment, however it's effect is fantastic and can even recure lands such as ghost quarter or even the more value play of Eternal Witness getting the land as well. So much value in one card. </li>
                            <li><b>History of Benalia</b> - $0.50 - This enchantment comes with 2 bodies and pump spell for the knights later. This card with the right deck can help turn the late game into a hard to win situation for your opponent</li>
                            <li><b>Restoration Angel</b> - $0.40 - A combo staple for creature decks, even with a few cards on this list it bolsters those cards to new heights and can at worse be a flash blocker for those pesky fliers.</li>
                            <li><b>Thraben Inspector</b> - $0.20 - A small creature that can draw cards with the help of it's enter the battlefield token</li>
                            <li><b>Prismatic Ending</b> - $0.50 - This is one of the best removal spells for it's rate and in multicolored decks it shines even more</li>
                            <li><b>Aven Mindcensor</b> - $0.25 - Opponent cracks a fetch land sounds like a time to make them sad to me.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>White Two Dollar Fifty Cent Cards</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Thalia, Guardian of Thraben</b> - $1.20 - First Strike and the tax on noncreature spells really make this a great card, the one toughness is a bit bad however.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>White Five Dollar Cards</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Card Title</b> - $#.## - Cool card I guess</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2><a href="https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/5447007#paper">$50 Humans</a></h2>
                        <a href="../../assets/img/50tokens.jpg"><img class="img-fluid" src="../../assets/img/50tokens.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <p>This deck is a low to the ground humans deck with a simple gameplan smack the opponent in the face until they are no more. The main power of this deck comes from Thalia's lieutenant and champion of the parish. Also with cards such as Sanctifier en-Vec, Thalia, Guardian of Thraben, and even Anointed Peacekeeper we can slow the opponent down while still fighting hard.</p>
                        <p>The big downside to this deck is the lack of safety to fast combo decks such as Devoted Druid decks and Neobrand style decks. Additionally this deck does not do well against the card fury or supreme verdict which happens quite a bit. Finally there is the whole thing about how Murktide Regents and other big creatures will out scale our creatures and make it impossible to get in the final points of damage.</p>
                        <p>There are a few routes to this deck mono-white humans, taxes, or 4/5 color humans. In all cases Esper sentinal is the best card to pick up in this deck for that purpose. Also the landbase can be greatly improved with cards such as silent clearing for more card draw, cavern of souls to make our creatures uncounterable, and Eiganjo, Seat of the Empire for some more removal and utility. Aether vial is also a great pickup later down the road to help speed up the deck</p>
